# Trump Tweets Topic modelling

![trump_wordcloud](trump-03.png)


Natural Language Processing (NLP) project.


Using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), I performed a topic modelling on the tweets of Donald Trump from July 19th to December 16th.
The dataset is originated from [Kaggel](https://www.kaggle.com/gpreda/trump-tweets).


Here are the steps that I followed:
- Step 1: Reading the data
- Step 2: Exploring the data
- Step 3: Cleaning the dataset
- Step 4: Tokenization
- step 5: Stopwords removal
- step 6: Lemmatization
- step 7: Topic modelling
